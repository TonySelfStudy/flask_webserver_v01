## Project Name & Summary
*Flask webserver and http client*  

A flask webserver application was designed and is now
running on pythonanywhere.  The app serves as proof of
concept on how to send and receive json data over secure
servers via http.  This framework will be built upon
in subsequent apps.

## Usage
Run `python client_v01.py` to create various web requests
for the flask server running remotely.

In addition, one can modify the flask app as a simple 
starter web app project on your own server.

## Results
View the html files in [server_responses](server_responses)
for example http requests and results.
